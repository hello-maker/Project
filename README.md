# Project
Network-based deep learning model in cancer cell line screens predicts anti-cancer drug efficacy in patients  
1. Merge Gene Expression Data with Pathway Data 
2. Prepare Input Data of Deep Learning
3. Fit the Training Data to Deep Learning model
4. Predict IC50 and Identify Biomarker 
5. Validate our Model by Survival Analysis Using Clinical Data
